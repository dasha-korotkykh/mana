**Mana** â€” from Polynesian translates as _"supernatural power"_. In videogames it is referred to as magic and **indicates power to use special abilities** or "spells". 
When management team at [Ricker Lyman Robotic](https://rickerlyman.com/) initiated bonus program to provide employees with a tool to exchange gratitude within company, **mana** was naturally chosen as currency name for these bonuses, because saying "thank you" is not much different from casting a spell.

This project is meant to present usecases of recognition platform by [bonus.ly](https://bonus.ly/), personified _(and hopefully gamified)_ for RLR internal use.
